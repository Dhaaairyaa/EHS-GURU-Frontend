        description:"The Manual Handling Assessment Charts (MAC) is a tool to help users identify high-risk workplace manual handling activities. It is designed to help us to understand, interpret and categorize the level of risk of the various known risk factors associated with manual handling activities. Our specialists also conduct detailed evaluations of indoor air quality, examining factors like pollutant levels, ventilation, air circulation and environmental factors like indoor lighting, noise and heat stress. Training on ergonomics is crucial for promoting employee well-being, productivity, and overall job satisfaction. We organize trainings based on the requirements and considering the assessment results. Our interactive trainings sessions cover all the relevant topics associated with the workspace. We have divided our training programs in two parts:"
